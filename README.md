# TWC Homework

I recently taught myself clojure and have used it in a web app that provides the persistance and logic of my hipchat integrations for my team's chatroom at CareerBuilder [Here](https://github.com/cmm0004/jobluv), but otherwise its purely a language I use outside of my professional experience.

I would very much like to use it professionally however, or any functional language. I have use Go profesionally, and I liked it, but worry its a bit young to be risking using in a production environment.
